Using Local Binary Patterns and Support Vector Machines to Classify Gender from Facial Images


This project involves developing a system to determine a person's gender from facial images using machine learning techniques. The key methods to be explored are Local Binary Patterns (LBP) for facial feature extraction and Support Vector Machines (SVM) for gender classification.

LBP is an image processing algorithm that extracts descriptive features from images by encoding local texture patterns. It will be applied to preprocess facial images and extract discriminative information about facial features like eyes, nose, mouth etc.

These LBP feature vectors will then be used to train SVM classifiers to categorize images as either male or female. SVM is a powerful supervised learning model suitable for binary classification problems. Different kernel functions and hyperparameters will be evaluated to optimize the SVM model.

The outcome will be an automated system that can accurately predict the gender of a person from their facial image based on the learned patterns using LBP and SVM. The performance will be evaluated on standard face datasets in terms of classification accuracy, precision and recall. This project will provide hands-on experience in implementing computer vision and machine learning techniques for an image classification task.
